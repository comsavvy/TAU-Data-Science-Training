# Data Science and Machine Learning Training Course

Welcome to the Data Science and Machine Learning Training Course at Thomas Adewumi University. This course is designed to equip you with the essential skills and knowledge in PowerBI, Excel, R, and Python, empowering you to analyze data, derive insights, and build predictive models in various domains.

## Course Overview

The course is structured into four main modules, each focusing on a different toolset:

1. **PowerBI**: Learn to create interactive dashboards and reports to make data-driven decisions.

2. **Excel**: Master advanced Excel techniques for data analysis including pivot tables, complex functions, and data visualization.

3. **R**: Dive into statistical analysis and graphical representations with R to handle data more effectively.

4. **Python**: Explore Python for data science, focusing on libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand and apply data science and machine learning concepts.
- Use PowerBI to visualize and share insights from data.
