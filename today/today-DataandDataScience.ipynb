        "Data is present everywhere and is collected every day. We make calls and send messages on the phone every minute. We tweet messages on Twitter, post pictures and videos on Instagram, countries like Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia count their citizens and foreigners at a well-defined point of time, hospitals take clinical records of patients, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this available huge amounts of data, organizations are focusing more and more on using the insights from data to evaluate progress, build solutions and make an informed decision. The need to extract useful insight is a must for a business in today’s world.\n",
        "## Definition of data\n",
        "\n",
        "Data refers to unorganized and unprocessed facts, which does not hold complete meaning unless it is being processed to drive meaningful insights. In other words, data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things. That is, data can be words (texts, sounds, images, or numbers written on papers, stored on a computer, and infact, it could be a fact that is stored inside your mind right now.\n",

        "The problem that we have with data, is that, data is fundamentally inert or static in nature, and has no real meaning or value until we analyze it. Data is raw material for information and the result of data processing is called information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Type of data\n",
        "\n",
        "Data can be qualitative or quantitative.\n",

        "### 1. Qualitative data\n",
        "\n",
        "This refers to data that can be observed and recorded. It is non-numerical in nature. This type of data is collected through methods of observations, one-to-one interviews, survey, opinion of people on a particular topic, and similar methods. Examples of qualitative data include gender (male or female), opinion (agree, neutral, disagree), Blood type (A, B, AB, and O), state of origin (Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, etc.), and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Quatitative data\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantitative data is the type of data that can be measured in the form of numbers or counts. For example, distance from Unilorin to TAU, number of hours to complete introduction to data science 1, length of a table, revenue realised by Somalian government, speed covered by a car, age of a student, weight of a goat, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantitative data has quantifiable information that can be used for mathematical computations and statistical analysis which informs real-life decisions. For example, a manufacturing company in Uganda will need an answer to the question, “How much is the production cost?”. Quantitative data can be used to answer questions such as “How many?”, “How often?”, “How much?”.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "#### 1. Discrete data\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete data is a type of data that consists of counting numbers only. That is, it can be counted\n",
        "and has a finite number of possible values. Examples of discrete data includes the number of students taking introduction to data science 1, the number of days in a year, number of females in South Sudan, etc. You can see that these data take on only certain numerical values. Also, if you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero (no call), one, two, or five.\n",
        "\n",
        "When trying to identify discrete data, we ask the following questions; Can it be counted? Can it be divided into smaller parts?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Continuous data\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous data is a type of data that arise as a result of measurement. It has an infinite number of possible values within a given range. Example of continuous data includes height, weight, temperature and length.\n",

In other words, data scientist focuses on analysing the past and current data, predicting the outcomes with the sole aim of making information.\n",

        "**Tidy**: Another step is data cleaning or munging, and it is one of the most time-consuming tasks of a data scientist. Since much of the datasets available are not cleaned, it is, therefore, a data scientist's work to prepare the datasets in an easy to use format.\n",
